Precision Practice

Although my UI design leaves much to be desired, Precision Practice functions well as a basic aim trainer.

Built in Unity, available from Itch.io [here.](https://dagarian.itch.io/precision-practice) 

Upon launching, you enter into a small arena fenced in the middle with a podium in the center.

Shooting the podium allows you to start a time trial where you shoot orbs of varying sizes.

Difficulty and orb colour can be changed in the trial's settings.

Pressing Esc will pause and open the main menu.
